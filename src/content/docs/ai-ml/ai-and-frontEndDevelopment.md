## Introduction

Front-end web development involves coding the user-facing elements of websites and applications using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It requires both technical programming ability and design sense to translate user-centric design specifications into highly efficient, interactive, visually appealing and functional user interfaces.  On the other hand, AI is a branch of computer science that aims to build machines and programs that can mimic human intelligence. As a result, AI refers to machines and programs that perform tasks we normally associate with human intelligence. AI in frontend development refers to using machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to improve web application design, functionality, and user interaction.

## A brief history of frontend development

You may use a bullet point list or subheadings to structure a timeline of your chosen topic's history:
- 1990-1995: The Dawn of the Web: HTML and CSS
The early days of the web were completely static HTML pages with limited CSS sprinkled in. Users did not expect interactivity and websites only worked on one screen-size. You can think of this as the "Read only" period of the web.
- 1995-2000: The Rise of JavaScript
JavaScript was initially designed as a lightweight language for client-side scripting, making it possible to add interactivity and other dynamic elements to web pages. With the advent of JavaScript, web developers could now create animations, form validations, and more, which significantly improved the user experience.
- 2006: The jQuery Revolution and Web 2.0
In 2006, John Resig released jQuery, a fast and lightweight JavaScript library that simplified DOM manipulation, event handling, and animation. Many of today's websites still rely heavily on jQuery! This was also the time when Web 2.0 emerged. This evolution can be seen as the "Read and Write" period of the web as we now see user-generated content, such as blogs and social media, completely take over the space.
- 2010-Present: The Rise of Frontend Frameworks
As web applications became increasingly complex, frontend developers sought ways to streamline their workflows and create more maintainable code. This led to the emergence of various frontend frameworks and libraries, which offered structure, reusable components, and best practices for building web applications. Frameworks were making it easier than ever to make websites feel more like a web application. This is about the time when SASS (Software as a service) companies begin to explode onto the scene.

## A brief history of AI

You may use a bullet point list or subheadings to structure a timeline of your chosen topic's history:
- AI's birth and early successes
John McCarthy officially coined "Artificial Intelligence" as a term for the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, which is often considered the birth of AI as a field. Early pioneers like Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon believed creating software that could mimic human-like problem-solving was possible.
The 1960s and 1970s saw some of AI's first successes. Examples include Newell and Simon's "General Problem Solver" and the development of ELIZA by Joseph Weizenbaum, which created human-like conversation.
- AI's turbulent journey
AI's journey was challenging. It faced its first "winter" in the mid-1970s due to inflated expectations and subsequent funding cutsâ€”a similar pattern occurred in the 1980s.
Despite the challenges, the 1990s marked a shift towards practical applications. Companies began incorporating AI in real-world applications, such as speech recognition. Developing algorithms like backpropagation enabled training of more complex neural networks, sowing the seeds for future breakthroughs.
- The AI boom
The 2010s saw explosive growth in AI, primarily driven by deep learning, which could process vast amounts of data. Deep-learning gets its inspiration from replicating the structure of the human brain. Breakthroughs like Google DeepMind's AlphaGo defeating the world champion in Go showcased AI's vast potential.
Another factor fuelling AI's rise is the exponential increase in computational power and data. Technologies such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) have drastically sped up the training of neural networks. The internet era has also provided vast amounts of data, which is the lifeblood of many modern AI models.
