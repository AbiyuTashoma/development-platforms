## Introduction

Front-end web development involves coding the user-facing elements of websites and applications using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It requires both technical programming ability and design sense to translate user-centric design specifications into highly efficient, interactive, visually appealing and functional user interfaces.  On the other hand, AI is a branch of computer science that aims to build machines and programs that can mimic human intelligence. As a result, AI refers to machines and programs that perform tasks we normally associate with human intelligence. AI in frontend development refers to using machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to improve web application design, functionality, and user interaction.

## A brief history of frontend development

You may use a bullet point list or subheadings to structure a timeline of your chosen topic's history:
- 1990-1995: The Dawn of the Web: HTML and CSS
The early days of the web were completely static HTML pages with limited CSS sprinkled in. Users did not expect interactivity and websites only worked on one screen-size. You can think of this as the "Read only" period of the web.
- 1995-2000: The Rise of JavaScript
JavaScript was initially designed as a lightweight language for client-side scripting, making it possible to add interactivity and other dynamic elements to web pages. With the advent of JavaScript, web developers could now create animations, form validations, and more, which significantly improved the user experience.
- 2006: The jQuery Revolution and Web 2.0
In 2006, John Resig released jQuery, a fast and lightweight JavaScript library that simplified DOM manipulation, event handling, and animation. Many of today's websites still rely heavily on jQuery! This was also the time when Web 2.0 emerged. This evolution can be seen as the "Read and Write" period of the web as we now see user-generated content, such as blogs and social media, completely take over the space.
- 2010-Present: The Rise of Frontend Frameworks
As web applications became increasingly complex, frontend developers sought ways to streamline their workflows and create more maintainable code. This led to the emergence of various frontend frameworks and libraries, which offered structure, reusable components, and best practices for building web applications. Frameworks were making it easier than ever to make websites feel more like a web application. This is about the time when SASS (Software as a service) companies begin to explode onto the scene.

## A brief history of AI

You may use a bullet point list or subheadings to structure a timeline of your chosen topic's history:
- AI's birth and early successes
John McCarthy officially coined "Artificial Intelligence" as a term for the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, which is often considered the birth of AI as a field. Early pioneers like Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon believed creating software that could mimic human-like problem-solving was possible.
The 1960s and 1970s saw some of AI's first successes. Examples include Newell and Simon's "General Problem Solver" and the development of ELIZA by Joseph Weizenbaum, which created human-like conversation.
- AI's turbulent journey
AI's journey was challenging. It faced its first "winter" in the mid-1970s due to inflated expectations and subsequent funding cuts—a similar pattern occurred in the 1980s.
Despite the challenges, the 1990s marked a shift towards practical applications. Companies began incorporating AI in real-world applications, such as speech recognition. Developing algorithms like backpropagation enabled training of more complex neural networks, sowing the seeds for future breakthroughs.
- The AI boom
The 2010s saw explosive growth in AI, primarily driven by deep learning, which could process vast amounts of data. Deep-learning gets its inspiration from replicating the structure of the human brain. Breakthroughs like Google DeepMind's AlphaGo defeating the world champion in Go showcased AI's vast potential.
Another factor fuelling AI's rise is the exponential increase in computational power and data. Technologies such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) have drastically sped up the training of neural networks. The internet era has also provided vast amounts of data, which is the lifeblood of many modern AI models.

## Main Features

The world of front-end development is always changing. As AI changes how websites are made, developers need to keep learning. This way, they can use AI as a powerful tool to make great websites. Here are ways how Front-End Developers could implement AI to enhance their work.

### Automated design and layout

AI tools can automate and speed up the design process. Front-end developers can use AI tools to create a good-looking prototype or mockup designs in minutes. AI tools can also turn low-fidelity wireframes into high-fidelity prototypes. Other AI tools can automatically analyze layouts and styling and generate code matching the design.

AI tools to use are Uizard and Anima.

Key tips:
- **Use AI prototyping tools:** AI tools like Uizard will help you create prototypes quickly, saving you a lot of time and thus accelerate web and application development.
- **Stay updated about new AI tools:** AI tools are rapidly evolving, so make sure to stay updated about new developments and tools.
- **Test and iterate on AI designs:** Rigorously test AI designs with real users and iterate based on their feedback.

### Code generation and optimization

AI coding assistants are game changers for front-end development and software development in general. They are already widely adopted, too. According to a GitHub survey, 92% of software engineers are already using them. And there’s a good reason why they use it, AI coding assistants can significantly speed up tasks like Code refactoring, Code generation and Writing code documentation.

AI tools work by turning natural language prompts into coding suggestions and offering intelligent code completion. They will help automate repetitive tasks and work more efficiently. And they can be easily integrated into integrated development environments (IDE). The AI suggestions are based on context and the style conventions of the code.

AI tools to use are Amazon CodeWhisperer, CodiumAI, Github Copilot and Tabnine.

Key tips:
- **Create customized code templates:** AI tools can be used to create customized code templates based on the coding style and project requirements.

- **Automate repetitive tasks:** Use AI coding assistants to automate repetitive, routine tasks so you can focus more of your precious time on solving more complex issues.

### Improving accessibility and user experience (UX)

1.3 billion people i.e. 16% of the world population, that’s how many people in the world have significant disabilities. That is why building accessible web apps and developing an accessible UI in your application is so important.

AI tools can improve applications accessibility and UX significantly. Some of the innovative ways AI tools can be used to improve web applications' accessibility and UX are: Voice AI for real-time translation, Voice shopping, Virtual dressing rooms, Image assistance.

Further more AI tools can be used to improve the existing web app without having to integrate new AI models and technologies. AI tools like Userway can help do an accessibility audit of a web application, it can check if it complies with the latest WCAG guidelines. It can even optimize the code to be more inclusive and usable.

AI tools to use are Userway and Testim.
